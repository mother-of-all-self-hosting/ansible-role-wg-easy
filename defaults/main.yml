# Controls the `INIT_IPV6_CIDR` environment variable, affecting the initial unattended setup.

#
# By default, most operating systems will prefer using IPv4 instead of IPv6 when making outgoing connections when their network interface is configured with a ULA.
# To get outgoing IPv6 working, you need to configure the network interface with a Global Unicast Address (GUA) that you own,
# or a GUA-like address - like the documentation-reserved prefix (`2001:db8::/32`).
#
# The default value here is a Global Unicast Address (GUA), which goes against the upstream defaults of wg-easy,
# which use Unique Local Address (ULA) value of `fdcc:ad94:bacf:61a4::cafe:0/112`.
# We do this, so that outgoing IPv6 connections will be preferred over IPv4 out of the box.
#
# If you can use your own GUA address here, we recommend doing that.
# For example, if you get `2001:555:5555:5555:/64` from your ISP for your network,
# you could assign something like `2001:555:5555:5555::0:cafe:0/112` for your 1st (`0`-th) wg-easy instance.
# If you run more wg-easy instances in your network, you could use `2001:555:5555:5555::1:cafe:0/112`,
# `2001:555:5555:5555::2:cafe:0/112`, etc. for them, so that they all have unique subnets.
